Simulation of a Cone Beam CT of the ICRP110 phantom placed in a gantry I constructed, producing the corresponding projection radiograph image at different angles.
Starting from the ICRP110phantom Advanced example of Geant4-11.2.2 "https://github.com/Geant4/geant4/tree/e58e650b32b961c8093f3dd6a2c3bc917b2552be/examples/advanced/ICRP110_HumanPhantoms".
